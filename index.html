   <h4>Only need 3 lures</h4>
   <h6>Why should you use them?</h6>
   <p>To survive you need food, what if you don’t know how to hunt and you're afraid of animals? Fishing will be your next choice for the source of protein, and not to only eat berries. While the berries could give you a little energy boost, you cannot survive while eating only berries, you need protein, and other elements that come from fish,  it will fill you for a while and also give most of the elements to survive.</p>
   <p>Worms is a great choice for catching variety of fish, but you may not find them, or even just simply don’t want to use them you could use a paddle tail/flukes (kinds of soft plastic swimbaits), if you want to stand out for feeding bass, use white colored, or use bright colored lures in murky waters and  use natural colored soft plastics in  clear waters. What does it have a ton of weeds? Use something that has its hook covered, like Texas jigged soft plastic or a football jig, and a frog that can go though the thickest stuff that you throw it in since it’s a topwater and it got its hooks fully covered</p>
   <img align="right" src="Screenshot 2025-10-08 130111.png">
   <p><h4>From taking all of these points into consideration, the top three lures are;</h4></p>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>The shad paddle tail swimbait</strong> on a jig-head (since it have the best hook up ratio):
      <ul>
      <li>On a <strong>jig-head</strong>, it has the best hook up ratio, casts far, and customize the size and the weight of the jig-head.</li>
      <li>Weedless <strong>texas rig</strong>, perfect if the body of water has weeds and after you cast, you just get a salad of weeds, well look no further if you were to put it on a weedless hook, but it may mess with your hook up ratio but it's still a great choice.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>natural colored</strong> soft plastics to have most of the versatility in clear water and maybe even not so clear waters, but try to go more bright colors if used in murky water with bad visibility and try go natural it don't know what to chose</li>
      </ul>

    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>The topwater frog</strong>, the best for covering some of the thinkest weeds you can possible fish in, since it's a topwater which got all of its  hooks covered, it may not get the best hook up ratio but it is so much fun if you get a top water bite:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The color of your frog, more people use <strong>bright colored</strong> (as shown in the picture), for good visibility for fish, but also try more natural color, like <strong>brown</strong>, that may not stick out as much, but still get striked if for some fish the bright color may be too much and they can just get scared</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><strong>The inline spinner baits</strong>, have a great hook up ratio (because of the threable hook), have a ton of flash, and vibrations.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Color,</strong> the spinner have a lot of flash and vibrations, so the does not matter as much as in other lures, but try to use<strong> yellow, orange</strong> and <strong>red</strong> colors that can stand out even more in murky waters, and <strong>silvery</strong> colors in streams with a lot of rocks and not too much algae, to try to imitate a fish of sorts, for bass, bluegills and even trout.</li>
    </ul>
   </ul>
